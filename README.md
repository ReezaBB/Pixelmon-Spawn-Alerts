# [Pixelmon-Spawn-Alerts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelmon-spawn-alerts)
A Minecraft _1.16.5_ addon Mod for Pixelmon Reforged _9.0.0+_ which adds customizable spawn alerts for when Pokémon spawn.

Currently the mod does one simple thing: When a shiny Pokémon spawns around the player a sound effect will play, much like the system on Pixelmon Generations, or originally Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Required on both the client (the sound effect), and the server (playing the sound effect).
This mod is still in very early stages of development.
