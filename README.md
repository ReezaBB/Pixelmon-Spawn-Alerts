# Pixelmon-Spawn-Alerts
A Minecraft (1.16.5) addon Mod for Pixelmon Reforged (9.0.0+) which adds customizable spawn alerts for Pokemon.

Currently the mod does one simple thing: When a shiny pokemon spawns around the player a sound effect will play, much like the system on Pixelmon Generations, or originally Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus. Required on both the client (the sound effect), and the server (playing the sound effect).

This mod is still in very early stages of development.
